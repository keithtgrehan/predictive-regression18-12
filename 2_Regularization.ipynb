    "When training and evaluating a model, you will often have to deal with the problem of over- or underfitting. A simple way to prevent overfitting of a polynomial model is to reduce the number and degrees of polynomials. The linear regression model implemented in Scikit-Learn offers no further hyperparameter to constrain the complexity of the model. Fortunately, Scikit-Learn offers two other linear models: `Ridge Regression` and `Lasso Regression`. Both models can be used to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting which can occur with simple linear regression.\n"

    "You can see that our lasso model with alpha = 0.5 performs rather bad and only uses 10 features. Lowering alpha to allow for a more complex model results in a better performance. The RMSE of our models with alpha = 0.05 and alpha = 0.005 are quite similar but there is still quite a difference in the number of features which are used. Since less features often makes it easier to interpret our model we will go for alpha = 0.05. \n",
